As a business owner, you need your operations to continue uninterrupted, even through circumstances that can bring things to a grinding halt; but when time is short, it\u2019s hard to know where to turn.<\/h4>\n<p>There are all kinds of emergencies that face businesses today \u2013 sudden power cuts, water damage from heavy rain, equipment failure, or even natural disasters. They all happen, and they\u2019re all sudden. A cooling emergency is when you have stock or equipment that needs to be kept cold or frozen, but your equipment is no longer able to do so.<\/p>\n<p>Dry ice has been used very successfully in situations like that for a long time. For example, grocery and supply stores order dry ice during power cuts to pack into fridges to keep stock cold \u2013 otherwise, it will spoil and have to be written off. Losing stock like that can be extraordinarily costly, particularly when power cuts last quite a while. The losses are compounded by the loss of business. The cost of having emergency dry ice delivered quickly is tiny when compared to the cost of catastrophic loss of stock.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just perishable stock that can be affected, however: server rooms that need constant cooling can be damaged when the power goes out. When backup power is only sufficient to keep the equipment running, dry ice can drastically reduce the load on generators and batteries by stepping in for the cooling units. Any sensitive equipment that can be damaged by overheating can be preserved with the use of dry ice, from laboratory equipment to sensitive instruments, computing units, large printers and so much more. Repeated overheating can damage some of these machines beyond repair and render them unusable.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that there is help available, and it arrives quickly too.
