Many of us are preparing to head out, whether locally or abroad. South Africans love their 4\u00d74 trips and bush adventures \u2013 there\u2019s nothing quite like packing the family up in the car and going into the wild, away from the city for a while. Relaxation!<\/h3>\n<p>The biggest challenge in trips like that, though, is how to keep things cool long enough. Meat, perishables and drinks need to be insulated and surrounded with water ice packs, and they generally last a day or so. There\u2019s an easier way, though!<\/p>\n<p>Dry ice is much colder than water ice, at -78.5\u00b0C (compared to 0\u00b0C for water ice). As it warms, it doesn\u2019t melt; it sublimates, meaning it turns directly from a solid to a gas. No water, no spilling, no fuss! It\u2019s the easy way to make sure that your supplies stay frozen or cold without having to worry about water pooling in your cooler bags and sloshing around in your car.<\/p>\n<p>Because dry ice is so much colder than water ice, you need a lot less of it, too. This means more space in your bags for your supplies, and as an added bonus, less weight in your car \u2013 saving you fuel on long-haul trips! It\u2019s an ideal solution.<\/p>\n<p>Dry Ice International has supplied dry ice to families and groups going on holiday for decades. Because of this, we know how best to pack cooler boxes according to what the contents are, as well as how much dry ice you\u2019ll need for the duration of your holiday.
